Feature: conflicts between the main branch and its tracking branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | existing | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the current branch is "existing"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION | MESSAGE                   | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT   |
      | main   | local    | conflicting local commit  | conflicting_file | local content  |
      |        | origin   | conflicting origin commit | conflicting_file | origin content |
    And an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town hack new"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                     |
      | existing | git add -A                  |
      |          | git stash -m "Git Town WIP" |
      |          | git checkout -b new main    |
      | new      | git stash pop               |
    And the current branch is now "new"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And this lineage exists now
      | BRANCH   | PARENT |
      | existing | main   |
      | new      | main   |
    And the uncommitted file still exists

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                     |
      | new      | git add -A                  |
      |          | git stash -m "Git Town WIP" |
      |          | git checkout existing       |
      | existing | git branch -D new           |
      |          | git stash pop               |
    And the current branch is now "existing"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
